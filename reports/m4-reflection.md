# Milestone 4 - Reflection

## Additional Parts Implemented


We incorporated all of Daniel's feedback and most of the suggestions from our coursemates.


Here are the specific changes we implemented for the following milestone:

- Precomputed all data from the default options to ensure fast app loading
- Added a reset button
- Used LRU cache for checklists to optimize performance
- Added a section in README for how to clone and run the app locally
- Added currency for the balance plot
- Download button for the filtered data
- Removed "?" for binary variables
- Used a binary format for loading data
- Checked for redundant filtering, slow computation
- Used caching for at least one function
- Corrected minor styling problems
- Set a favicon and tab title
- Updated the gif in the README

## What is done differently

Everything went as planned. There were some minor details added which we haven't thought for initially, like info tab or favicon. While the main components were all consistent with the sketch.

## Corner cases

We checked for most of the corner cases, there are no errors. If there are some, please write an issue for us we will be happy to address it later :)

## Deviations from the best practices

There were no deviations from the best practices we learned in 531. The only plot that was a bit misleading is the square plot. However, we discussed that with Daniel and Nima, it shouldn't be too critical.

## Strengths and Limitations

The main strength of our dashboard is that it's simple and intuitive. Filters on the right side, plots and cards on the left side. The main insights of the data are easy to grasp. 

There is one major limitation we would like to address in the future. Our dashboard will not look good for tablets or phones. We would like to make the design more consistent for different devices and screen resolutions.
