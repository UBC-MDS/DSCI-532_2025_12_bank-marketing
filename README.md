# Bank Marketing Dashboard

## Project Summary

This project aims to develop a **Bank Marketing Dashboard** to help financial institutions optimize their telemarketing strategies for term deposit subscriptions. By analyzing client demographics, financial status, and previous marketing interactions, we seek to identify key factors influencing customer decisions.

The dashboard will provide **interactive visualizations** that enable marketing managers to explore customer characteristics and improve targeting strategies. Our goal is to help financial institutions increase conversion rates, reduce unnecessary outreach, and enhance overall campaign efficiency through data-driven insights.
