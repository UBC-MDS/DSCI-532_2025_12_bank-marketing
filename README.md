## Welcome!

Our **Bank Marketing Dashboard** helps financial institutions optimize their telemarketing strategies for term deposit subscriptions. By analyzing **client demographics, financial status, and previous marketing interactions**, we seek to identify key factors influencing customer decisions.

The dashboard will provide **interactive visualizations** that enable marketing managers to explore customer characteristics and improve targeting strategies. Our goal is to help financial institutions **increase conversion rates, reduce unnecessary outreach, and enhance overall campaign efficiency through data-driven insights.**

## 🎬 Demo

Please take a look at the **GIF below** for a quick demo of our dashboard!
